#### Pediatric Health Record System

This was built last 2014 using CodeIgniter framework for a Pedia Clinic here in our local community.

I know this is not the best implementation but can be improved. This system is still running and used in the clinic.

##### How to use:

1. Create a database named phrs
2. Import file phrs.sql for initial data
3. Edit file application/config/database.php for your database info
4. Edit file application/config/config.php for some configurations
